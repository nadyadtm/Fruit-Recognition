# Fruit-Recognition
This is my assignment 3 in recognition system course 2018 in Telkom University

I do not own the dataset. My lecturer refer the dataset from this link https://rgbd-dataset.cs.washington.edu/dataset/rgbd-dataset/ (The fruit that use in this assignment is apple, banana, lemon, lime, orange, peach, pear). You can try it from these dataset (choose the image with the filename *crop.png)

If you want to study about how the code works, you can visit my medium article here
